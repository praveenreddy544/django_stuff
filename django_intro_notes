## install django pip modules using pip install django (this pulls down django and install)

## go to your desired directory and then, django-admin startproject <projectname>

## Inside yoru project(created in earlier step), there will be various required files

## Look at your poejct files created by django-admin, to know what are they ### research like use of settings.py ,wsgi.py, etc

## After taking a look, run your server using "go to project path where your  manage.py is there and run python manage.py runserver"

## For first time, since you specified sqlite3 in your settings.py, when you run app will be started making note about mgirations, so to get rid of that migrations message, use

## python manage.py  makemigrations and python manage.py migrate

## These mgrations were related to installed_app in settinsg.py that does some pre-configuratio by django (If you need proof, use db browser sqlite3 or navigate 
## to that database and see tables that were created )
